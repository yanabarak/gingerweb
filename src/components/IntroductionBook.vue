        Welcome to the official brand guidelines of the Guberman brand and assets. This document is
        intended to educate anyone who is responsible for creating internal or external

        It is important that we all share a basic understanding of how and when to use our identity.

        it easy for you to integrate Guberman in all media formats while respecting our brand and
        legal/licensing restrictions.

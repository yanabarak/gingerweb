        A mission statement is, in some ways, an action-oriented vision statement, declaring the
        purpose an organization serves to its audience. That often includes a general description of
        the organization, its function, and its objectives. Ultimately, a mission statement is
        intended to clarify the "what," the "who," and the "why" of a company. It's the roadmap for
        the company's vision statement.
